## Bier Garten
It's summer, it's hot and you're looking to throw back some beers in the sun. Where do you go? The park of course!
Luckily, we've gathered all the parks in your vicinity.

## Running the application
On launch of the application, the user immediately can view a map of Stockholm with markers placed inside each park. The different graphical representations of these markers indicates the rules set for public drinking in each of the parks displayed. For a more in-depth explanation of the markers, the user could access the “About” page by clicking the upwards pointing button and then by clicking the button represented with the letter “i.”

By clicking the button “Drink,” a route will be calculated from the users location to the closest park in which the user could enjoy a cold beer under full legality. In the case of the user having a personal preference of which park to visit, the marker indicating that park could be clicked and a further click on the button “Take me there” would calculate the closest route to that preferred park instead.

If the user enjoyed their stay in a park recommended by Bier Garten, that park could be favorited and stored in a user personal list of favorite parks. Setting parks to favorite is done by clicking the marker of that certain park and a further click on the button “Favorite.” Favorite parks set by the user can later be view in the “Favorites” page by clicking the upwards pointing button and then by clicking the button represented with the a heart.

If the user later on would only prefer directions to parks set as favorites, a switch could be set in the main page to only display and calculate routes for the favorite parks of the user.
